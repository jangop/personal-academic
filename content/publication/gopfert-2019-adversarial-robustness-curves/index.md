The existence of adversarial examples has led to considerable uncertainty regarding the trust one can justifiably put in predictions produced by automated systems. This uncertainty has, in turn, lead to considerable research effort in understanding adversarial robustness. In this work, we take first steps towards separating robustness analysis from the choice of robustness threshold and norm. We propose robustness curves as a more general view of the robustness behavior of a model and investigate under which circumstances they can qualitatively depend on the chosen norm.
